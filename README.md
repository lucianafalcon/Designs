# 3D Electronic Component Designs for PCB Modeling
These are 3D models of electronic components that I created, intended for use in PCB design. The files are in .FCStd format (FreeCAD) and can be converted to other formats like .STEP for use in PCB design software.

## Components Included:
- Potentiometer
- Terminal Block
- Switch
- Battery
- Battery Holder
- Nut

## Download
You can download the 3D models from the repository or contact me if you need specific formats or further details.
